## CSS
This is a project that will allow students to select the classes that they would like to take, and will allow
counselors to view that information and see on average how many sections of each class to open up. It will also
export an excel spread sheet for the counselors that will have all of this information within it.

## Hopes
I hope to get permission from LAUSD to connect this into MISIS so that I can make the process even more seamless.
It should just show all of the information that would be exported within the Walk-In tab of MISIS.
